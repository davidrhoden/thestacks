The Story:
-----

The Stacks started because I was in a pajama-wearing band called The Sleepy Heads that was very good but contained at least two stubborn people. The other stubborn guy wanted to go in a more rehearsed, canned (in my view) direction, with rehearsals and choreography and songs that had set running times. I wanted to be more spontaneous, with new songs every show, and just let the songs go as long as people stayed out of the chairs.

We broke up, but we had a couple of gigs booked I wanted to play, so I said, "let's start a cover band" just for these two or three gigs. (The name <i>The Stacks</i> refers to the "stacks" of records we would be covering.) That was about twenty years ago. I guess we just forgot to stop.
