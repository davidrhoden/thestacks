- The Itch

I got the bug! I got the itch!
I got the bug, got the itch, and I'm really in a fix
I gotta move
I got the itch
I got the bug, I got the itch, and I'm really in a fix
Ah well, I got to keep movin' boys!

I went to a party with a cat named Mike

I met up with a girl named Sue
I found out she had the itchin' too

Well the flat-top cats and the dungaree dolls
Playing all night at the sock hop ball
At the ball we had a jamboree
Didn't get back till a quarter past three



Early in the mornin' and dont you know
Too damn weak to hear the rooster crow

I got to rock--I got the itch
I got the bug, I got the itch, and I'm really in a fix
Ah well, I got to keep movin' boys!
