The Saturn Bar reopened with new management, and a really nice new sound system. We sounded as good as I've ever heard us. Chan (an original Stack) got up and screamed in the microphone like he used to. I really liked this show.

A guy in the crowd handed me this drawing he did of me, Andrew, and Chan singing "I'm Wild".
