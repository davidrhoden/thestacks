Our drummer, Andre, got transferred to a better job, so he's leaving town. Yet another Stacks drummer.... He's been an awesome drummer and he also has a recording studio in his house. We started these recordings right as the pandemic was becoming real. I think the first stay-at-home orders came a day or two after we started. Now that I've spent a couple months in quarantine, gaining weight, we're finishing it up.
