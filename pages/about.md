Current bio:
-----

The Stacks are a rock and roll band from New Orleans, Louisiana. The band set out to perform Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley-related music, but they also absorbed a lot of more modern stuff from the atmosphere, such as the performance style of Clarence Carter, or the comedy of Blue Oyster Cult.

The current line up is guitar player [Dave Rhoden](https://davidrhoden.com), Andrew Donaldson (of Athens, GA's [Mercyland](https://mercyland-athens.bandcamp.com/album/we-never-lost-a-single-game), and formerly of several zydeco outfits) on bass, and Steve Walkup (of more bands than I can count) plays the drums.

The Stacks are on Bandcamp at [https://thestacksnola.bandcamp.com/](https://thestacksnola.bandcamp.com/).


The Story:
-----

The Stacks started because I (Dave) was in a pajama-wearing band called [The Sleepy Heads](https://sleepy-heads.bandcamp.com/album/sleepy-heads) that was very good, but contained at least two stubborn people (one being me). The other stubborn guy wanted to go in a more rehearsed direction, with _rehearsals_ and _choreography_ and songs that had set running times. I wanted to be more spontaneous, with new songs every show, and just let the songs go as long as people stayed on their feet.

The Sleepy Heads broke up over this stubbornness, but we had a couple of gigs booked that I still wanted to play, so I said, "let's start a cover band" just for these two or three gigs. (The name <i>The Stacks</i> refers to the "stacks" of records we would be covering.) That was about twenty years ago. I guess we just forgot to stop.
