@gonerrecords posted this old flyer on Instagram. My memories of this show are so faint that it was either exactly as advertised or we didn't play it at all. 

Can somebody remind me what happened? Usually I just need a hint.

I feel like this show ended up getting canceled after the advertising was done. Anybody remember diferent?
