We finally started recording for real just when the coronavirus lockdown was beginning and now it looks like we may have to wait a while to finish. We're recording in our drummer Andre's home studio and everything's sitting there all set up; my amp's in the bathroom, pointed at the john.

Maybe we'll end up finishing this thing remotely, just sending the tracks to each other somehow.

When we do finish, it'll probably join our other recordings on [Bandcamp](https://thestacksnola.bandcamp.com).
