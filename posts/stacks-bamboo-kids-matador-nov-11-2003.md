I had played with Bamboo Kids in New York, so I got in touch with them and said "come get me, I'll show you how to get to WTUL" because they had an interview scheduled with "Miss Conduct", a DJ I knew pretty well.

We found our way to the studio, Karen (Miss C.) let them pick some records, and then she asked them some questions to let the audience get to know them.

"So, what are some of your influences?"

The singer/guitarist, Dwight, answered. "Well, you know, The Stones, The Stooges.  The important ones."

Karen said "Hmm, wow, very interesting. Hey, Dave!...what are your influences?"

Without a pause I answered: "DAFFY DUCK!"
