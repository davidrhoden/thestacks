I might have a picture from this evening. The bar had no liquor but the owner, [Terry Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Bike_Is_a_Pipe_Bomb), said the cook might have something. The cook said, sure, he'd give me a drink, but first I had to do something for him. He'd heard I did a pretty on-point Cosby impression and if I would do it, the drink would be mine.

So I clowned around doing impressions for drinks like a low life. When I got to the part about "Theo, these designer shirts you wear" he helpfully provided the information "these _Gordon Gartrell_ designer shirts". But I got a laugh and a drink. Turned out to be ouzo, though.
