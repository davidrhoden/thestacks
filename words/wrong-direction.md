(You Got My Mind Going In The) Wrong Direction


Baby!
You're gonna drive poor me insane
Baby!
You put a spike right though my brain
I love you!
My love is so good, gonna take you out to Hollywood

Woman!
I heard you call me a liar
Woman!
That's why I set your house on fire
I love you!
My love is so bad, gonna get to know your dad

That's okay, I don't feel right
I'm wasted every day, and I wasted every night
You Got My Mind Going In The Wrong Direction

Baby you drive me insane
I'm a car on the tracks; you're a passenger train
My love is so good, my love is so bad
Come on baby, why you tryin' to leave me so sad?
Aaaah!

Sugar!
I know you're sweeter than a candy bar
Sugar!
I'm here to introduce a rock and roll star
I love you!
My love is so strong, gonna sock it to ya all night long

That's okay, I don't feel right
I'm wasted every day, and I wasted every night
